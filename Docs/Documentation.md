## Architecture Baselines

There is four module in Application
- VideoBrowser.Itf for Interfaces (lazy reference coupling)
- VideoBrowser.App for UI logic
- VideoBrowser.Common for common BusinessLogic infrastructure
- VideoBrowser.Client for BusinessLogic

### VideoBrowser.App

General UI style defined in *App.xaml* file, and all style used as *StaticResource*. The MainWindow specific UI description (e.g. layout, custom view, list etc.) can be found in *MainWindow.xaml* Used UI elements and user controls are the nexts:

- Unified Butttons with key *BasicButton*, and custom styled *LoadButton* and *PagerButton* [Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/xaml-styles)
- TextBlock for Info about Paging State with key *PageInfo* [Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/controls/styles-templates-overview?view=netdesktop-5.0)
- Combobox for Filter has key *FilterComboBox*
- Two Panel style are defined, one for Vertical panel with key *MenuPanel* and one for the Horizontal panel of pager controls with key *PagerPanel*
- Layout defined in *MainWindows.xaml* [Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/layout/grid-tutorial)
- Scrollable Video list is also defined in *MainWindow.xaml* [Link](https://www.iranthajayasekara.com/blog/display-images-in-a-wpf-listbox.html)

IoC Kernel also implemented in this module, because it's not necessary to organize to an other separated module. The Kernel is responsible for Initializing and Dispose operations in BusinessLogic, but the MainWindow handles the Kernel.

### VideoBrowser.Client

This module contains the BusinessLogic. Two main responsibilies are defined (expect the domain, data and dto objects):
- VideoListContentController: fetch User actions in BL, evaluate and forward it.
- VideoSourceConnector: connect to the server, download data, retriev with content data.

Dots are only for communication, it's not supposed to occure outside of VideoSourceConnector.
Video Data objects are public and can be seen by Application layer as well. The binding of them to the UI is intended.

### VideoBrowser.Common

The general purposed infrastructural logic are separated from the core BusinessLogic. The implemented and used functionalities in Common module are:
- BasicLogger: to log main operation in BL.
- EnvironmentalInitializer: to prepare and clean environment (last files and folders), to read and provide config data of software.

### Tests

There is no tests for this project. Applied only manual tests.

There is an initial test api what had been used until the real api was not available.
