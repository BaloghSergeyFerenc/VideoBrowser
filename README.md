# VideoBrowser

After cloning and building this application, it requires a config text file to run.

So without this textfile the application won't run.

Please ask me for config file.
If you have the config file, then copy it in to bin folder of VideoBrowser.App project, then run the application.

The detailed documentation can be found in Docs folder.
